# VoG-TextGame
Text Based game about Vault of Glass from Destiny 2. Written in Python.

This was my first coding project for my Computer Science degree. I had never used Python before and much of the course was about pseudocode.
There are likely a number of errors and the code could be improved upon. I chose to upload it as is to document my growth as a developer.
I also didn't want to invest too much in this as I'm not sure if there would be legal issues, but Destiny has been my favourite game for the last 7 years so I wanted to dedicate this project to it.
